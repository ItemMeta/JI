# JI AntiCheat
If you are reporting an error, please include the entire stacktrace that you see in console.

If you are reporting a bypass, please include the client name, and the check, and what mode/module is bypassing it. In most cases we will instantly close bypass issues to not clutter the tracker, but we do work on patching the bypass.

Thank you,
~ JI Team.
